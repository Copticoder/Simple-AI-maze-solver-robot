# Simple-AI-maze-solver-robot
a simple AI robot that traverses a maze or a labyrinth with two solutions.
The idea was to implement a control system in the robot which corrects it's path with the readings of the ultrasonic sensors in both of his right and left sides in order not to hit the wall by his sides when it rotates. Also, for the rotation it had a front ultrasonic sensor reading that detects whether there is a wall or not and based upon his left and right readings, it decides when to rotate.
